- gRParse shell (`examples/web-demo/server.js`, same day): the streaming tab drew
  bottom-left point boxes as top-left pixels, mirroring the fast-path overlay down
  the page; `mapBoundingBox` now flips by `coord_origin` against the page height.
  Verified with a zoomed headless capture of the repair receipt: every box on its text.
